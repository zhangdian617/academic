  abstract = {Cryptocurrency price forecasting plays an important role in financial markets. Traditional approaches face two challenges: (1) it is difficult to ascertain the influential factors related to price forecasting; and (2) due to the 24/7 trading policy, cryptocurrencies’ prices face very large fluctuations, thus weakening the forecasting power of traditional models. To address these issues, we focus on Bitcoin and identify the influential factors related to its price forecasting from the perspective of underlying blockchain transactions. We then propose a price forecasting model WT-CATCN, which leverages Wavelet Transform (WT) and Casual Multi-Head Attention (CA) Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), to forecast cryptocurrency prices. Our model can capture important positions of input sequences and model the correlations among different data features. Using real-world Bitcoin trading data, we test and compare WT-CATCN with other state-of-the-art price forecasting models. The experiment results show that our model improves the price forecasting performance by 25%.}

  abstract = {Smart wheelchairs based on brain–computer interface (BCI) have been widely utilized recently to address certain mobility problems for people with disability. In this paper, we present SmartRolling, an intuitive human–machine interaction approach for the direct control of robotic wheelchair that jointly leverages EEG signals and motion sensing techniques. Specifically, SmartRolling offers two wheelchair-actuation modes for users with different physical conditions: (1) head motion only — people who are severely disabled but able to do basic tasks using eyes and head, and (2) head and hands motion — in addition to type 1, people who can use functioning hands/arms for extra tasks. The system issues operation commands by recognizing different EEG patterns elicited by motor execution (ME) tasks including eye blink, jaw clench, and fist open/close, while at the same time estimates users’ steering intentions based on their facing direction by leveraging inertial measurements and computer vision techniques. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed system is robust and effective to meets the individual’s needs and has great potential to promote better health.}

  abstract = { Counting the number of moving objects in a given area has many practical applications. By investigating a series of state-of-the-art technologies, we propose a Moving Object Counting approach using Ultrasonic Sensor networks (MOCUS). In MOCUS, we deploy a network of three-node ultrasound sensor clusters, with each cluster having one ultrasound transmitting node and two ultrasound receiving nodes. Such three-node sensor clusters can successfully offset interference problems and accurately detect the direction of moving objects. In order to cover a wide area, MOCUS employs multiple sensor clusters, forming a wireless sensor network. To alleviate the impact of object moving velocity, shape of objects and distinguish closely tied multiple objects, we introduce intra-cluster analysis and inter-cluster cooperation techniques. We deploy a MOCUS prototype in our lab and evaluate the design through extensive experiments. }

  abstract="Many applications in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) benefit significantly from organizing nodes into groups, called clusters, because data aggregation and data filtering applied in each cluster can greatly help to reduce traffic. The size of a cluster is measured by the hop distance from the farthest node to the cluster head. Rather than 1-hop clustering, K-hop clustering is preferred by many energy-constrained applications. However, existing solutions fail to distribute clusters evenly across the sensing field, which may lead to unbalanced energy consumption and network inefficiency. Moreover, they incur high communication overhead. We propose an Evenly Distributed Clustering (EDC) algorithm. Constrained by the maximum cluster size K, EDC distributes clusters uniformly, and minimizes the number of clusters. By introducing a relative synchronization technique, EDC converges fast with low communication overhead. It also helps to improve the successful transmission rate from nodes to their cluster heads. The simulation results indicate that EDC outperforms other existing algorithms.",

  abstract = {Given widely adopted vehicle tracking technologies, usage-based insurance has been a rising market over the past few years. With potential discounts from insurance companies, customers voluntarily install sensing devices in their vehicles for insurance companies, which are utilized to analyze their historical driving patterns to derive the risks of future driving. However, it is challenging to characterize and predict driving patterns, especially for new users with limited data. To address this issue, we propose and evaluate a system called MoCha to accurately characterize driving patterns for usage-based insurance. The key question we aim to explore with MoCha is whether we can fully explore long-term driving patterns of new users with only limited historical data of themselves by leveraging abundant data of other users and contextual information. To answer this question, we design (i) a multi-level driving pattern modeling component to capture the spatial-temporal dependency on both individual and group level, and (ii) a multi-task learning method to utilize underlying relations of driving metrics and predict multiple driving metrics simultaneously. We implement and evaluate MoCha with real-world on-board diagnostics data from a large insurance company with more than 340,000 vehicles. Further, we validate the usefulness of MoCha by predicting driving risks based on real-world claim data in a Chinese city, Shenzhen.},

  abstract="Tree structure metric-space indexing methods recursively partition data according to their distances to a set of selected reference points (also called pivots). There are two basic forms of data partitioning: ball partition and General Hyper-plane (GH) partition. Most existing work only shows their superiority experimentally, and little theoretical proof is found. We propose an approach to unify existing data partitioning methods and analyze their performance theoretically. First, in theory, we unify the two basic forms of partitioning by proving that there are rotations of each other. Second, we show several theoretical or experimental results, which are able to indicate that ball partition outperforms GH partition. Our work takes a step forward in the theoretical study of metric-space indexing and is able to give a guideline of future index design.",

  abstract="Taxis are a major means of public transportation in large cities, and speeding is a common problem among motor vehicles, including taxis. Unless caught by sensors or patrol officers, many speeding incidents go unnoticed, which pose potential threat to road safety. In this paper, we propose to detect speeding behaviors of individual taxis from taxi trajectory data. Such detection results are useful for driver risk analysis and road safety management. However, the taxi trajectory data are geographically sparse and the sample rate is low. Furthermore, existing methods mainly deal with the estimation of collective road speeds whereas we focus on the speeds of individual vehicles. As such, we propose to use a two-fold collective matrix factorization (CMF)-based model to estimate the individual vehicle speed. We have evaluated our method on real-world datasets, and the results show the effectiveness of our method in detecting taxi speeding behaviors.",

  abstract="Teeth alignment plays an important role in orthodontic treatment. Automating the prediction of teeth alignment target can significantly aid both doctors and patients. Traditional methods often utilize rule-based approach or deep learning method to generate teeth alignment target. However, they usually require extra manual design by doctors, or produce deformed teeth shapes, even fail to address severe misalignment cases. To tackle the problem, we introduce a pose prediction model which can better describe the space representation of the tooth. We also consider geometric information to fully extracted features of teeth. In the meanwhile, we build a multi-scale Graph Convolutional Network(GCN) to characterize the teeth relationships from different levels (global, local, intersection). Finally the target pose of each tooth can be predicted and so the teeth movement from the initial pose to the target pose can be obtained without deforming teeth shapes. Our method has been validated in clinical orthodontic treatment cases and shows promising results both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

  abstract="Nowadays, the increasing car accidents ask for the better driver behavior analysis and risk assessment for travel safety, auto insurance pricing and smart city applications. Traditional approaches largely use GPS data to assess drivers. However, it is difficult to fine-grained assess the time-varying driving behaviors. In this paper, we employ the increasingly popular On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) equipment, which measures semantic-rich vehicle information, to extract detailed trajectory and behavior data for analysis. We propose PBE system, which consists of Trajectory Profiling Model (PM), Driver Behavior Model (BM) and Risk Evaluation Model (EM). PM profiles trajectories for reminding drivers of danger in real-time. The labeled trajectories can be utilized to boost the training of BM and EM for driver risk assessment when data is incomplete. BM evaluates the driving risk using fine-grained driving behaviors on a trajectory level. Its output incorporated with the time-varying pattern, is combined with the driver-level demographic information for the final driver risk assessment in EM. Meanwhile, the whole PBE system also considers the real-world cost-sensitive application scenarios. Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the performance of PBE in risk assessment outperforms the traditional systems by at least 21{\%}.",

  abstract = {Traffic flow prediction provides valuable traffic information to transportation agencies and individuals in advance. Compared to next-step prediction, multi-step prediction provides users with traffic information for a longer time horizon, allowing users to have a more comprehensive understanding of traffic conditions. So far, various methods have been proposed for multi-step traffic flow prediction. However, most of them become sub-optimal in effectively detecting the spatio-temporal correlations of traffic data. Furthermore, as the number of prediction steps increases, the input data used to predict the flow of the next step tends to deviate further from the ground truth value. This deviation leads to a rapid decrease in prediction accuracy as the number of prediction steps increases. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a deep spatio-temporal representation learning network named ST-RLNet for multi-step traffic flow prediction. The goal is to effectively generate the traffic data representation by better capturing the complex correlations of the data. In particular, we design a network called 3D-ConvLSTMNet to effectively extract short-term and long-term spatio-temporal data correlations for the next step prediction. To solve the performance degradation problem, we propose a feedback mechanism called PS-Feedback to dynamically reconstruct temporal correlation representations of input traffic flow for each round of next-step prediction. To evaluate the performance of the ST-RLNet, we conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Experimental results show that the ST-RLNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both next-step and multi-step predictions, and exhibits consistent high performance under different traffic flows.}

However, the dropout events, which are often present in scRNA-seq data, remaining challenges for downstream analysis. Although a number of studies have been developed to recover single-cell expression profiles, their performance may be hindered due to not fully exploring the inherent relations between genes. To address the issue, we propose scDTL, a deep transfer learning based approach for scRNA-seq data imputation by harnessing the bulk RNA-sequencing information. We firstly employ a denoising autoencoder trained on bulk RNA-seq data as the initial imputation model, and then leverage a domain adaptation framework that transfers the knowledge learned by the bulk imputation model to scRNA-seq learning task. In addition, scDTL employs a parallel operation with a 1D U-Net denoising model to provide gene representations of varying granularity, capturing both coarse and fine features of the scRNA-seq data. Finally, we utilize a cross-channel attention mechanism to fuse the features learned from the transferred bulk imputation model and U-Net model. In the evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that scDTL could outperform other state-of-the-art methods in the quantitative comparison and downstream analyses.},

  ABSTRACT = {Radio frequency (RF) technology has been applied to enable advanced behavioral sensing in human-computer interaction. Due to its device-free sensing capability and wide availability on Internet of Things devices. Enabling finger gesture-based identification with high accuracy can be challenging due to low RF signal resolution and user heterogeneity. In this paper, we propose MeshID, a novel RF-based user identification scheme that enables identification through finger gestures with high accuracy. MeshID significantly improves the sensing sensitivity on RF signal interference, and hence is able to extract subtle individual biometrics through velocity distribution profiling (VDP) features from less-distinct finger motions such as drawing digits in the air. We design an efficient few-shot model retraining framework based on first component reverse module, achieving high model robustness and performance in a complex environment. We conduct comprehensive real-world experiments and the results show that MeshID achieves a user identification accuracy of 95.17% on average in three indoor environments. The results indicate that MeshID outperforms the state-of-the-art in identification performance with less cost.},

In this paper, a simple and efficient inverse consistent image transformation estimation algorithm is proposed to preserve correspondence of landmarks and accelerate convergence. The proposed algorithm estimates both the forward and backward transformations simultaneously in the way that they are inverse to each other based on the correspondence of landmarks. Instead of computing the inverse functions and the inverse consistent transformations, respectively, we combine them together, which can improve computation efficiency significantly. Moreover, radial basis functions (RBFs) based transformation is adopted in our algorithm, which can handle deformation with local or global support. Our algorithm maps one landmark to its corresponding position exactly using the forward and backward transformations. Moreover, our algorithm is employed to estimate the forward and backward transformations in robust point matching, as well to demonstrate the application of our algorithm in image registration. The experiment results of uniform grids and test images indicate the improvement of the proposed algorithm in the aspect of inverse consistency of transformations and the reduction of the computation time of the forward and the backward transformations. The performance of our algorithm applying to robust point matching is evaluated using both brain slices and lung slices. Our experiments show that by combing robust point matching with our algorithm, the registration accuracy can be improved and the smoothness of transformations can be preserved.}

To this end, we consider ultra-massive multi-input multi-output (UM-MIMO) systems, where channel estimation is performed by resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. Due to the use of hybrid beamforming technology, channel estimation is challenging in such UM-MIMO systems, which requires recovering high-dimensional channels from severely few channel observations. By utilizing the sparsity characteristic of beamspace channels, the beamspace channel estimation problem can be formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem, which can be solved by the greedy orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm. To improve the performance of this algorithm, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based OMP algorithm, namely DNN-LOMP, in which a previously trained DCNN model is adopted to choose a set of dominant beamspace entries simultaneously. Due to the high computational complexity of training the DCNN model in the DNN-LOMP scheme by resource-constrained IoT devices, we propose a channel estimation scheme, namely PR-LOMP, where a pruning technique, including training with regularization, pruning and refining procedures, is employed to reduce the scale of the DCNN. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation schemes. The results demonstrate that the PR-LOMP scheme with 30% pruning achieves better performance compared to the DNN-LOMP scheme with much lower computational complexity.}

Through the adaptation of lens antenna array, mmWave channels have a sparsity feature in the beamspace domain, which results in the requirement of a reduced number of RF chains for such a system. Using the sparsity of beamspace channels, the beamspace channel estimation problem can be formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem, which can be solved by the greedy OMP algorithm, where dominant beamspace channel entries are found sequentially one by one, iteratively. To improve the performance of this algorithm, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based OMP algorithm, namely LOMP, in which a previously trained DL model is adopted to choose a set of beamspace dominant entries simultaneously instead of a single dominant entry. As we consider the downlink channel estimation, constructing a DL model well-accepted by all users requires them to send received signals to a centralized entity with high computational power. However, this incurs huge communication burden owing to the signal transmission by all users. To tackle this issue of communication burden as well as preserve the privacy of received signals, we propose a decentralized federated learning (FL)-based OMP algorithm, namely FL-OMP, in which the peer-to-peer (P2P) FL technique is adopted to construct the DL model in the LOMP algorithm, where users share gradients of their local learning models among themselves. Extensive simulations have been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LOMP and FL-OMP algorithms while comparing with other works in the existing literature.}

	abstract = {Motivation The growing amount of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data allows researchers to investigate cellular heterogeneity and gene expression profiles, providing a high-resolution view of transcriptome at the single-cell level. However, dropout events, which are often present in scRNA-seq data, remain challenges for downstream analysis. Although a number of studies have been developed to recover single-cell expression profiles, their performance is sometimes limited by not fully utilizing the inherent relations between genes.Results To address the issue, we propose a deep transfer learning based approach called scDTL for scRNA-seq data imputation by exploring the bulk RNA-sequencing information. scDTL firstly trains an imputation model for bulk RNA-seq data using a denoising autoencoder (DAE). We then apply a domain adaptation architecture that builds a mapping between bulk gene and single-cell gene domains, which transfers the knowledge learned by the bulk imputation model to scRNA-seq learning task. In addition, scDTL employs a parallel operation with a 1D U-Net denoising model to provide gene representations of varying granularity, capturing both coarse and fine features of the scRNA-seq data. At the final step, we use the cross-channel attention mechanism to fuse the features learned from the transferred bulk imputer and U-Net model. In the evaluation, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that scDTL based approach could outperform other state-of-the-art methods in the quantitative comparison and downstream analyses.Contact zhangd{at}szu.edu.cn or tianj{at}sustech.edu.cnCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract="In this paper, we propose AIMSafe, an electroencephalographic (EEG) based system that studies driver in-vehicle behaviors leveraging Attention networks and Incremental learning Mechanism for road Safety. Instead of using predefined classes, we categorize driver in-vehicle activities into different risk levels - a stronger motion may have a higher chance of unsafe driving. More specifically, we first employ a CNN based model to distinguish two basic activities - 1. normal driving and 2. unsafe driving. Moreover, AIMSafe also leverages smartphone IMU sensors generating soft hints that helps automatically label EEG data on road. We then adopt class-incremental learning to rank other Out-of-Distribution (OOD) driver activities (safe to unsafe) based on the Mahalanobis distance. A modified Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block is also used to adaptively select effective EEG electrodes for improving the system efficiency. Evaluation results (involving 11 males and 4 females) show that AIMSafe could achieve a detection accuracy over 95{\%} on unsafe driving activities using only 4 electrodes.",

abstract="Detecting object shape presents significant values to applications such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality and surveillance. Traditional solutions usually deploy camera on site and apply image processing algorithms to obtain object shape. Wearable solutions require target to wear some devices, and apply machine learning algorithms to train and recognize object behaviors. The recent advances in Radio Frequency (RF) technology offer a device-free solution to detect object shape, however a number of research challenges exist. This paper presents RF-Eye, a novel RF-based system to detect object shape without training in indoor environments. We design and implement Linear Frequency Modulated baseband signal, making it suitable for detecting object shape. We also apply the narrow pulse signal reflections and Doppler Frequency Shift to detect the full image of object shape. We implement RF-Eye on a Universal Software Radio Peripheral device. Our experimental results show that RF-Eye achieves 100{\%} successful rate, and it performance is reliable in complicated cases.",

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
