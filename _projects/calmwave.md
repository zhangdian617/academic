## Introduction

Mental health management is a critical challenge in modern society. **CalmWave** is an intelligent closed-loop system we designed to regulate user stress levels through generative music.

## How it Works

The system follows a "Perception → Recognition → Intervention → Feedback" loop:

1.  **Sensing:** Real-time monitoring of physiological data (EDA, EMG) via a wearable wristband.
2.  **Processing:** A customized stress-level classification model analyzes the user's state.
3.  **Generation:** Leveraging **MusicGen**, the system generates upbeat music for stress relief or calming melodies for relaxation.
